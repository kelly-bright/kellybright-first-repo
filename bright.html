    <h1><mark>THE THEORY OF DEMAND</mark></h1>
<p style="color:blue; font-weight:; font-size:30px; font-style:italic; font-family:venada;"><strong>Demand refers to the quantity of goods and services that consumers are willing to buy at a giving time over a giving period of time.</strong> A good definition of demand must include "
    quantity, price and time". Demand is  not the same as need or want or desire for something. This is because the desire for something is not back up by the willingness and ability to pay for it. It only become effective demand when there is the ability to pay. The first law of demand and supply states that "more of a good is demanded at a lower price than at a lower price everything being equal"</p>
